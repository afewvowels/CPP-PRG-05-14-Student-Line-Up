//  A teacher has asked all her students to line up according to their first name. For example,
//  in one class Amy will be at the front of the line, and Yolanda will be at the end.
//  Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of students in the class,
//  then loops to read that many names. Once all the names have been read, it reports
//  which student would be at the front of the line and which one would be at the end of
//  the line. You may assume that no two students have the same name.
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 or greater than 25 for the number
//  of students.
